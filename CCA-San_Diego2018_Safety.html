<span>CCA-San_Diego iGEM’s lab work is divided between three spaces: our school laboratory classroom, a biohacker’s warehouse, and a converted garage. Because of the restricted hours at the warehouse and school lab, the majority of our work had to be done in our garage. Although, the garage may seem like a cursory environment; we still enforced lab safety. The basic rules included wearing gloves, close-toed shoes, tied hair, no food or drinks, and safely disposing of hazardous materials. It was also important that we bleached the bacteria before disposing of it and kept in mind PPE, safe lab measures, and a clean environment. Our converted garage lab contains machines that we purchased or borrowed including PCR machines, a shaking incubator, a 4˚C fridge, a -20˚C freezer, a hot plate, a centrifuge, a vortex, scales, and laboratory reagents. Our school laboratory is a biosafety level one laboratory but contains enough equipment and protection to qualify as a biosafety level two with the exception of ventilation within the lab. The warehouse is quite a drive from our school, but it contains a lot of materials, such as microplate readers, reagents, and other laboratory products. We make sure to take appropriate measures in safety when working in the warehouse for producing, reading, and analyzing data created there.

CCA iGEM’s goal is to improve the environment; therefore, we specifically used E. Coli strain K12 because it is a non-pathogenic chassis, it is harmless to the environment. This specific bacteria does not cause diseases in humans.

<ul>
<li>using E. Coli, harmless to the environment, it is a non-pathogenic chassis 
</li><li>Secretion of SslE by a safe strain would imply that SslE itself is not capable of promoting a disease state, and would invite comparisons of SslE function between pathogens and non-pathogens. Furthermore, if non-pathogenic E. coli could secrete SslE, the T2SSβ system could be studied using a non-pathogenic model organism. ….. Relevant??
</li><li>non-pathogenic E. coli secretes enzymes that are not harmful 
</li><li>when looking at degradation pathways, we made sure there was no harmful byproducts that would be released. Rather, there is energy released for the bacteria to use
</li><li>riboswitch controls protein coding, it stops it from proteins from being synthesized
